        <h3>Why am I doing this project</h3>
        <p>
          I am completing this project to highlight the skills I have learned as
          an aspiring Web Developer. This will be a live project that serves as
          my resume. This gives potential employers a chance to see what I can
          do, other projects I have completed/been a part of, education, and
          work experience.

        <h3>Why is this necessary?</h3>
        <p>
          Every job I have applied to in my adult life has required that I
          submit some form of resume, and now the transition into tech, often a
          website link. If I could showcase things I have done previously and my
          resume in the same place, it could make me a more viable candidate vs.
          someone who does not have their work showcased.
